This is not a blog post about the show, although I hear it's quite good. Here the expanse refers to "the expanse of an early senior year summer" - part of the current introduction to my website because I deem it semi-fitting for the current circumstance of my life. 

Because of its association with space, the expanse implies an emptiness in my life. But there's people in the world who are my age with *real* problems so emptiness makes me sound like just another overly dramatic teenage and I'm not and there's also been some good things so expanse is probably not the right word. But I'm lazy.

I have a goals sheet most of the time. Right now it lists job stuff, driving, exercise, reading, and assorted outdoor activites like hiking. Looming behind like a cartoon villain moseying around smoke is college applications, but that's a story to tell for another day.
