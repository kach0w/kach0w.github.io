Yoohoo, from Fremont, CA! I'm some kid lost in the expanse of an early senior year summer so although I currently don't know what *I'm* doing, I can tell you that this website is - or at least was supposed to be - used for showing some machine learning projects and writing about things.   

I'm presently finding out what my interests may be. History is a clear one; I spend too much time on the backrooms of the internet reading Bay Area historical records and surfing/contributing to Wikipedia where I frequent articles about philosophy and historicity. 

When I'm not at my computer - which, let's face it, I'm at most of the day - you can find me reading books, watching movies, playing video games, and hiking. I also listen to a ton of rock; my favorite bands are R.E.M., the Beatles, and the Smiths. ðŸ¤˜
