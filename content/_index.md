Yoohoo, from Fremont, CA! I'm some kid lost in the expanse of an early senior year summer. Although I don't know what I'm doing, I can tell you that this website's original purpose was to showcase machine learning projects and occasionally be subject to my ramblings.   

I'm presently finding out what my interests may be. History is a clear one; I spend too much time on the backrooms of the internet reading Bay Area historical records and surfing/contributing to Wikipedia where I frequent articles about philosophy and historicity. 

When I'm not at my computer - which, let's face it, I'm at most of the day - you can find me reading books, watching movies, playing video games, and hiking. I also listen to a ton of rock; my favorite bands are R.E.M., the Beatles, and the Smiths. ðŸ¤˜
