Hello there! I'm a high schooler from Fremont, CA. I use this website to share projects and write about things.

I'm interested in machine learning, especially in the applications of computer vision. My other major interest is history. I frequently delve into local Bay Area records, ancient historicity, and philosophy on Wikipedia (I'm a bit of a fanatic).

When I'm not at my computer, you can find me reading, watching movies, biking along Alameda Creek, or listening to some rock. My favorite bands are R.E.M., the Beach Boys, and the Smiths. 🤘
